# What is the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) in Road Projects

## 1. Introduction

The **Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM)** is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model introduced by **NHAI in 2016** to develop road infrastructure. It merges features of **EPC** and **BOT** to balance risk between government and private contractors.

**Why HAM Matters:**

- Ensures timely road delivery
- Attracts both investors and policymakers

## 3. Technical Overview

### How HAM Works:
- Govt pays **40% during construction** in 5 milestones  
- Private player funds **60%**, reimbursed over **15 years**  
- Govt pays **interest + O&M costs**  
- Revenue risk stays with government  

### Key Stakeholders:
- **NHAI**: Funding + annuity
- **Developer**: Builds and partially funds
- **Lenders**: Finance developer's share

### Risk Sharing:
- **Construction**: Private
- **Revenue**: Government
- **O&M**: Private

## 4. Step-by-Step Guide

### Project Phases

#### Planning
- Identify the road project  
- Prepare DPR (Detailed Project Report)

#### Bidding & Award
- Invite bids from developers  
- Award project to lowest bidder

#### Financial Closure
- Developer arranges 60% project finance  
- Govt may offer Viability Gap Funding (VGF)

#### Construction

| Issue                   | Description                   | Solution                                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Delayed Payments        | Milestone-based payments slow | Use audit trails and automation         |
| Cost Overruns           | Rising materials/labor costs  | Add buffer funds and escalation clauses |
| Land Acquisition Delays | Land not ready before bidding | Secure land pre-bid                     |
| Financing Gaps          | Developer lacks capital       | Govt help via VGF or guarantees         |
