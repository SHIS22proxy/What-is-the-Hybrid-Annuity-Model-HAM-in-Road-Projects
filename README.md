# What-is-the-Hybrid-Annuity-Model-HAM-in-Road-Projects
1. Introduction
The Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) is a public-private partnership (PPP) model used in the development of road infrastructure projects in India. Introduced by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in 2016, HAM combines features of both the EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) and BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) models to balance risk between the government and private contractors.
